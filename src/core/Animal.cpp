// Animal class implementation
// Decompiled from Black & White v1.0 (runblack_decrypted.exe)
// Cross-referenced with bw1-decomp (v1.20)
//
// Animals are non-player living entities (cows, sheep, wolves, etc.)
// that roam the landscape. They can be eaten by creatures, sacrificed,
// and interact with the village economy.

#include <black/Animal.h>

// Animal has no new virtual methods — inherits Living's vtable.
// Override implementations for inherited virtuals (GetMesh, ProcessBySpell, etc.)
// will be added incrementally from the decompiled output.
